INCIDENT DESCRIPTION
====================
My Mercedes-Benz S-Class was parked on Marine Drive while I was at a late-night restaurant. Upon returning around 2:15 AM, I discovered significant damage to multiple parts of the vehicle. The damage appears inconsistent with a normal collision - possible staged accident or intentional vandalism. Front and rear bumpers damaged, windshield cracked with unusual pattern, deep scratches on both sides, and side mirrors broken. Strangely, no other vehicles nearby showed any damage.

Security cameras in the area were reportedly not functioning. No witnesses could be found at the scene at that hour. Police report filed but investigation ongoing.
